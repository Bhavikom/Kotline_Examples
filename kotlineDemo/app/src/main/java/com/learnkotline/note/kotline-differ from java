1. Removed findViewById() - Instead use kotline Extenstion to get id from xml
2. Writing POJO class is different than java - simple to write
3. In Kotlin, all classes extend from Any, which is similar to Object in Java. By default, classes are closed,
    like final classes in Java. So, in order to extend a class, it has to be declared as open or abstract
4. Two Type of constructor - Primary and Secondery .
5. Function return type should be at end of fuction name :
    fun add(x: Int, y: Int) : Int {
        return x + y
    }
6. function with defualt argument :
    An argument of the function can have a default value, for example:

    fun add(x: Int, y: Int  = 1) : Int {
        return x + y;
    }
    In that case, the add() function can be invoked by passing only the x argument Like == add(10)

7. Using Lambda expression - click listener in kotlin
    view.setOnClickListener{
        // body
    }
8. Null Safety
        => all variable and properties in kotlin are considered non-null(unable to hold null value)
        => If you want to explicitly declare variable as nullable(accept null value) a question mark must be added after the type.
            val number: Int? = null
        => null check using Elvis operator(?:)
            val number Int? = null
            val stringNumber = number?.toString() ?: "Number is null"
        => Another neat thing is that you can use throw or return on the right-hand side of the Elvis operator since they are expressions in Kotlin. For example:
           fun sendMailToUser(user: User) {
               val email = user?.email ?: throw new IllegalArgumentException("User email is null")
               //...
           }

        => If you want a NullPointerException thrown the same way as in Java,you can do that with the "!!" operator.The follwing code will throw a NullPointerException.

           val number: Int? = null
           number!!.toString()

        => Safe call operator(?.)
            Another way of using a nullable property is safe call operator ?.
            This calls the method if the property is not null or returns null if that property is null without throwing an NPE (null pointer exception).

            val number: Int? = null
            number?.toString()


9. Casting is simple

10. Model class is different than java  - In kotlin it's called  data classes

12. there is no need of new keyword in kotlin
13. there is no static keyword  - instead use companion object vs object
14. there is lateinit and lazy keyword to use
15. use when instead of switch case
16. there is no getter setter method directly call variable
17. if can be used an expression in Kotlin
18. two type of constructor primary constructor and secondery constructor
19. Inheritance - use open keyword before base class becoze By default, classes in Kotlin are final.
    If you are familiar with Java, you know that a final class cannot be subclassed.
    By using the open annotation on a class, compiler allows you to derive new classes from it

20. Void == Unit
21.kotlin extension function
23. null safety operators
    // safe call ?.
    // safe call with let ?.let{}
24. Use : instead of extends to inherite class
25. resources instead of getResources()
26. SmartCast
    ?.let
